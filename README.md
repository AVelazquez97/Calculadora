# Graphic Calculator

This is a very simple calculator that includes its four basic functions: 
-Addition
-Subtraction
-Multiplication
-Division

It was created using the next libraries/modules:
-tkinter
-os
-sys
-tkinter/ttk
-functools/partial

The main goal of this project was create my first GUI applying OOP concepts learned in a self-taught way.
